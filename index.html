        <h4>Bunkhouse Man Arrested for Stealing Green Chairs</h4>
        <p>
          &emsp;Long time bunkhouse resident Grant Wehrman was arrested Thursday
          morning after an incident in which he was caught trying to steal a
          green chair from a local furniture store. Wehrman, 17, was tied to
          multiple disappearances of green chairs from furniture stores all over
          the country in the last couple of years. Nebraska furniture mart (a
          subcompany of Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire-Hathaway) has been the
          biggest victim of theft, with the total amount of missing property
          reported to be over $2,000,000 this year. Founder and CEO Rose Blumkin
          stated: ‚ÄúIt feels very good to know that the criminal behind the
          disappearance of the green chairs is behind bars‚Äù and that she ‚Äúhopes
          the proper justice is served‚Äù for the perpetrator.<br />&emsp;Wehrman
          was arrested after the police raided a warehouse previously believed
          to be empty just outside of Wichita, Kansas. According to police
          reports, the police found pictures of the perpetrator along with
          thousands of stolen green chairs.<br />&emsp;Upon being arrested,
          Wehrman insisted his innocence. Wehrman will plea for innocence upon
          his court date next month, claiming that the property was not stolen
          by him, but rather his ‚Äúevil twin‚Äù. In the meantime, Wehrman will be
          attending rehabilitation, helping test out a pilot program for the
          Nebraska State Penitentiary.<br />&emsp;The goal of the rehabilitation
          program is simple. Help criminals addicted to seats with green
          upholstery change their thoughts regarding green chairs. The program
          coordinators hope that the program will help the convicted criminals
          go from coveting green chairs to serving others with them. The program
          partners with ‚ÄúThe Green Chair Project‚Äù in Raleigh, North Carolina.
          The Green Chair Project is a non-profit that was founded in 2010 to
          collect and reuse essential furnishings to benefit their Wake County
          neighbors in need, especially those in poverty and need. The Green
          Chair Project‚Äôs mission is to furnish homes and change lives. With the
          partnership with the prisons, the community should be benefitted
          through both changed lives and emerald furnishings. If you would like
          to donate to The Green Chair Project and continue to change lives,

        <h4>Doritos Gone Woke?</h4>
        <p>
          &emsp;On that fateful Saturday, July 29th, 2023, while in line for
          supper, Grant was getting exited to enjoy a walking taco after a
          rigorous Monkey Ball session. He excitedly grabbed a bag of Doritos
          expecting it to be filled with the cheesy snack, but his heart sank.
          It was empty. The crinkled relic was simply filled with air. A
          perplexed Grant shared his discovery, not knowing that his humble bag
          of chips would soon mean so much more.<br />&emsp;Quick to make the
          scene, Uncle Casey he declared that the empty Doritos bag was more
          than a snack mishap and rather the bag is a metaphor for how
          corporations are emptying our wallets while filling us with empty
          promises of inclusivity and woke culture. He waved his hand
          dramatically, accusing "woke corporations". Was this Doritos tring to
          shove their woke adgenda onto young children?<br />&emsp;With this
          infiltration of woke culture, The crunch of a chip would never sound
          quite the same again.
