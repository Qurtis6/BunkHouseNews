        <h4>The Green Chair Saga: More Green Chairs Stolen</h4>
        <p>
          &emsp;Grant Wehrman, best known for his kleptomaniac behavior towards
          green chairs, Has been attending rehabilitation, helping test out a
          pilot program for the Nebraska State Penitentiary. Wehrman has been
          making great strides towards recovery in the program and may even be
          the programs first graduate if things go well. There is only one
          problem: Green chairs are still going missing. Police are still
          investigating how these green chairs are going missing from furniture
          stores all across the Lincoln area. Reports from the prison show
          Wehrman is still in the Penitentiary, but police are now starting to
          wonder if he had any accomplices, or if they even locked up the
          correct man. The only thing police have found at the scene of the
          crime is a half- eaten ice-cream cone. Wehrman often gets frequent
          nighttime visits from one of the members of the office, coincidentally
          also named Wehrman. Andrew Wehrman, is often seen carrying a large bag
          out of the prison at night and will be called in for questioning later
          this week.

          Clash of Clans: JosephStalin Gets Outscored in Raid Weekend Three
          Weekends in a Row
        </h4>
        <h5>2/10/24 Max the Barbarian</h5>
        <p>
          &emsp;Jason Wehrman, who goes by the gamer tag <i>JosephStalin</i>, has been
          outscored in raid weekend three weekends in a row. Despite having a
          monstrous run in 2023, JosephStalin has started slow in 2024 in raid
          weekend. A Co-Leader of the Big Cheddar, JosephStalin has been a top
          scorer in the Clan Capital since its introduction. JosephStalin really
          started taking things to a new level when the clan unlocked Hog
          Raiders at Capital Hall Six. Using Hog Raiders and Battle Rams
          JosephStalin made light work of opposing district halls. In 2024,
          however, it has been a different story. Both Gouda and SquirrelExpress
          have outscored JosephStalin this year, leaving outsiders wondering if
          Jason’s brother Chaitan (known for his addiction to Supercell’s other
          gaming giant, Hay Day) has been using his attacks. This week alone, 
          SquirrelExpress and Gouda have put up very high scores, with 
          SquirrelExpress scoring 20,925 points and Gouda scoring 18,265, making
          a victory for JosephStalin a tall task. Don’t expect JosephStalin to 
          be out of that top spot for long, as his experience and reputation gives 
          us a lot of reason for confidence of his return, especially with five,
          potentially six, attacks left.

        <h4>Wehrman Sets School Record in the Heptathlon</h4>
        <h5>2/10/24 Bro. Ryan</h5>
        <p>
          &emsp;True Freshman Caleb Wehrman, of Tabor College, competed in the
          2023 Bulldog Early Bird Heptathlon at Concordia, University in Seward,
          Nebraska on December 8-9, 2023. In preparation for the 2024 Track and
          Field season, the Tabor College Blue Jays brought promising freshman
          Caleb Wehrman to compete in the heptathlon. Wehrman finished sixth in
          the meet, with a total score of 3696. Critics are not all impressed
          with the record, some even going as far as to claim that he only got
          the record because no athlete at Tabor had ever done the Heptathlon
          before. This of course, is not true, but Wehrman will most certainly
          be watched as he improves on his record over the next couple of years.

        <h4>Adam, Preston, Andrew, Enter Pokémon Tournament In Lawrence</h4>
        <h5>2/4/24 Bro. Ryan</h5>
        <p>
          &emsp;Adam, Andrew, and Preston have been on a single quest since age
          10: To become a Pokémon master. Starting at age ten, kids are allowed
          to pick a starter Pokémon and travel across the land to train them.
          Now in their twenties, Adam, Andrew, and Preston put their training to
          the test by entering a Pokémon card tournament in Lawrence, Kansas.
          The trio diligently put together decks, practiced together, and went
          on their way. While none of the Trio came home as the winner of the
          tournament, they still got to laugh and learn some valuable lessons
          along the way.<br />&emsp;When asked if they would ever return, each
          had a different response. Andrew, the most committed to the Pokémon
          franchise of the bunch, said he could see himself coming back for
          another shot at the tournament. Preston said he would do another one
          as well, as he is already a frequent competitor alongside his friend.
          Adam on the other hand, will probably not make another appearance in
          the tournament, noting that he felt rather out of place. “I felt very
          out of place”, Adam said. “I felt like most of the people there were
          still living in their parent’s basement with long hair and bad B.O.”.
          At this time, Adam is still interested in competing in smaller,
          friendly competitions amongst his friends and family where the B.O. is
          significantly less potent.

        <h4>Doritos Gone Woke?</h4>
        <h5>1/31/24 Bro. Raymond</h5>
        <p>
          &emsp;On that fateful Saturday, July 29th, 2023, while in line for
          supper, Grant was getting exited to enjoy a walking taco after a
          rigorous Monkey Ball session. He excitedly grabbed a bag of Doritos
          expecting it to be filled with the cheesy snack, but his heart sank.
          It was empty. The crinkled relic was simply filled with air. A
          perplexed Grant shared his discovery, not knowing that his humble bag
          of chips would soon mean so much more.<br />&emsp;Quick to make the
          scene, Uncle Casey he declared that the empty Doritos bag was more
          than a snack mishap and rather the bag is a metaphor for how
          corporations are emptying our wallets while filling us with empty
          promises of inclusivity and woke culture. He waved his hand
          dramatically, accusing "woke corporations". Was this Doritos trying to
          shove their woke agenda onto young children?<br />&emsp;With this
          infiltration of woke culture, The crunch of a chip would never sound
          quite the same again.

        <h4>Bunkhouse Man Arrested for Stealing Green Chairs</h4>
        <h5>1/15/23 Bro. Ryan</h5>
        <p>
          &emsp;Long time bunkhouse resident Grant Wehrman was arrested Thursday
          morning after an incident in which he was caught trying to steal a
          green chair from a local furniture store. Wehrman, 17, was tied to
          multiple disappearances of green chairs from furniture stores all over
          the country in the last couple of years. Nebraska furniture mart (a
          subcompany of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire-Hathaway) has been the
          biggest victim of theft, with the total amount of missing property
          reported to be over $2,000,000 this year. Founder and CEO Rose Blumkin
          stated: “It feels very good to know that the criminal behind the
          disappearance of the green chairs is behind bars” and that she “hopes
          the proper justice is served” for the perpetrator.<br />&emsp;Wehrman
          was arrested after the police raided a warehouse previously believed
          to be empty just outside of Wichita, Kansas. According to police
          reports, the police found pictures of the perpetrator along with
          thousands of stolen green chairs.<br />&emsp;Upon being arrested,
          Wehrman insisted his innocence. Wehrman will plea for innocence upon
          his court date next month, claiming that the property was not stolen
          by him, but rather his “evil twin”. In the meantime, Wehrman will be
          attending rehabilitation, helping test out a pilot program for the
          Nebraska State Penitentiary.<br />&emsp;The goal of the rehabilitation
          program is simple. Help criminals addicted to seats with green
          upholstery change their thoughts regarding green chairs. The program
          coordinators hope that the program will help the convicted criminals
          go from coveting green chairs to serving others with them. The program
          partners with “The Green Chair Project” in Raleigh, North Carolina.
          The Green Chair Project is a non-profit that was founded in 2010 to
          collect and reuse essential furnishings to benefit their Wake County
          neighbors in need, especially those in poverty and need. The Green
          Chair Project’s mission is to furnish homes and change lives. With the
          partnership with the prisons, the community should be benefitted
          through both changed lives and emerald furnishings. If you would like
          to donate to The Green Chair Project and continue to change lives,
